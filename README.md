# Hindelopenhandelaars
I collaborated with my classmates to create a game about trade in the North Sea. It's primarily a quiz game with some interactive gameplay elements. 
The game is currently featured in a museum, so I can't share the code publicly. However, you're welcome to visit the museum and play the game: Museum Hindeloopen: https://www.museumhindeloopen.nl/
